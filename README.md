# Barely opaque red

### What?
A tiny WebGL demo of something resembling a videogame. Work in progress.

### Where?
Here: https://youtu.be/_DCbMis3VsM

### Why?
Because Chinese characters can be so frustrating sometimes.

### How?
Turn left by swiping left or clicking the left side of the screen. Turn right by doing the opposite. Turn around by swiping down or clicking the lower part of the screen. Move forward by tapping or clicking anywhere else.

Start aiming by swiping up or pressing the G key. When aiming, enter the secondary fire mode by swiping up again or pressing the R key. Shoot by tapping or clicking anywhere on the screen. Put away the gun by swiping down or pressing the G key again.

When close to the "enemy," shoot it once while in secondary fire mode and start lowering its health with regular shots. If it sounds complicated, blame my English teacher.

### Which?
index.html and main.js in the src folder.

### When?
Hopefully before I graduate.

### Who?
Just a guy with a comfy keyboard.
